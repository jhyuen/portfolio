                <h2>PASSIONS</h2>
                <h3>1. Computer Science</h3>
                <p>For many computer science people including myself, they were introduced to computer science through playing computer games. For some, it was Command and Conquer, but for me, it was Starcraft. As I played Starcraft, I wondered how the little soldiers on screen moved around. This wonder opened my eyes to the wonderful world of computer science and software engineering. I dabbled in Java and HTML throughout middle school, but after I read the New York Times article Why Software is Eating the World, as suggested by my mentor, I was convinced that the coding life was for me.</p>
                <p>My respect for Steve Jobs has also contributed to my passion for computer science. His effort to highlight the human aspect of technology has always been an inspiration for me. It is because of him that I started my company known as Illum Softworks and actively seek to improve my entrepreneurship and artistic abilities.</p>
                <h3>2. Music</h3>
                <p>At the age of 5, I loved the idea of playing guitar and singing on stage, but being 5, I did not have the hand strength nor money to learn. This desire to express myself musically continued on with me, and at age 10, I was frustrated that I could not play a single chord or sing a pop song on the radio. As a result, I enlisted in my middle school choir and self-taught myself guitar using various online resources.</p>
                <p>Since then, I've developed my skills and have never looked back. When I go home for academic breaks, I lead worship at my home church. While at college, I lead worship for the WPI Christian Bible Fellowship. At the moment, I am trying learn how to play the piano via internet videos, and I hope to develop that skill further.</p>
                <h3>3. People</h3>
                <p>Some people desire to work simply for sustenance. While that desire is completely acceptable, I seek to additionally use my gifts and abilities to benefit others.</p>
                <p>After volunteering at homeless shelters, elderly homes, and refugee houses over the past 8 years, I realize that so many people are ignored in society. Our society says that marginalized groups of people are important, yet most of society is very unwilling to make the needed sacrifices to help those groups. As a result, I've made a commitment in whatever future work I do to make a beneficial difference in people's lives.</p>
